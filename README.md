Batch Sideloader for Oculus Quest / Go

Drag the install.bat file into a game folder and execute. It will install any apk in this folder and upload any folder to obb. If a install.txt file is found it will process all commands. 
ADB dependencies can be downloaded on first startup.

The install_copy.bat will copy the install.bat into any subfolder (first-level).
